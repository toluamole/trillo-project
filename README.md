# Trillo app landing page using CSS Flexbox
In this project i focused heavly on css flexbox to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container.
I also focused on BEM METHODOLOGY of naming classes to write well structured, clean and organized code.
I also used some advanced css concepts like animations,transitions, mask-image,fill properties and a CSS preprocessor (Sass).
